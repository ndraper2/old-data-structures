# data-structures
Contains a number of classic data structures, implemented in python.
This file contains:
Singly linked list
    Data structure utilizing nodes
Stack
    Data structure utilizing nodes with a "First In, Last Out" 
    organization.
    contains two constructors, one for the data node, and one
    for the stack itself. 
    The stack contains a reference to the first data node, and that
    is all. 
    A node contains a data value, along with a reference to the next
    node.

Proper Parenthetics
    A test to make sure that parentheses are properly opened and closed.
    Tells the user if the string is open(open parentheses are not closed),
    balanced (equal numbers in the proper order), or broken (a closing paren
    appears that didn't have an open one to match.)
